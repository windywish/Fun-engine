Implement for a living rule ecosystem where procedures evolve through players’ simultaneous and interdependent actions

Implement for mutation triggers that activate when guests perform coordinated actions, such as sampling candy together

Implement for interlinked rule sets where changes in one element (like hydration schedules) automatically adjust constraints in another

Implement for algorithms that detect and harness cross-pollination between contradictory procedures, triggering emergent events like the Night Elk Plan

Implement for rule evolve to ensure that evolving gameplay remains challenging yet fair across multiple interactive layers
