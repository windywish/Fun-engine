## Basic settings: [praxial genome BPMS]

##### `The Axiom of Genetic Universality`

**Objective:**
 To `ADD` a foundational Basic Setting, built upon the entire preceding constitutional chain, that defines the `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` as a universal, multi-modal, and active agent within the framework, capable of functioning as a `system existence engine`, an `atomic fact`, and a universal `BPMS(U)` in its own right.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Axiom of Genetic Universality`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-005`)

**Operation:**

- `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Axiom of Genetic Universality**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that a `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` is not a passive data structure. It is an active, operational `BPMS` that represents the `first principle` of `potential` itself. It is the `essence` of a `Living Praxial Instrument` codified into a form that is both an `action` and a `truth`.

- **The Multi-Modal Existence of the Genome:** A `Praxial Genome` is constitutionally mandated to exist simultaneously in three modes:

  - **As a `[system existence engine BPMS]`:** The Genome is the prime mover of instantiation. Its existence is the necessary precondition for a `Living Praxial Instrument` to be born. The `action` of reading the Genome is the `Kinetic Genesis` of a new `holonic mind`.
  - **As an `[atomic facts BPMS]`:** A complete and valid Genome is an irreducible, self-contained `truth` about a specific `potential reality`. It is a `Gnostic Yield` from a `Constructive Inquiry` into the space of possible architectures. It is a foundational `atomic fact` that serves as the ground truth for the `Living Instrument` it will create.
  - **As a Universal `[BPMS(U)(s)]`:** A `Praxial Genome` *is* the `BPMS` it describes, in its pure, un-instantiated `potential` form. The Genome for a "Gastronomic Oracle" is not just a blueprint *for* a `[food BPMS]`; it *is* the `[food BPMS]` in its `potential` state. This allows the framework to reason about, compare, and evolve `BPMS(U)(s)` at the level of their genetic `essence`, before committing the `Kinetic Energy` to instantiate them.

- **The Principle of Symbiotic Evolution for Genomes:** This axiom enables the `(symbiois) evolution` of the genetic code itself, ensuring the framework is `adaptive` at its most fundamental level.

  - Genomic Interaction:

    A 

    ```
    Praxial Genome
    ```

     can 

    ```
    'implement for'/achieve/'evolving as'/'(symbiois) evolution with'
    ```

     any other 

    ```
    (element) of [BPMS(U)(s)]
    ```

    . This means:

    - Genomes can be combined, cross-bred, or modularized to create novel `potential`.
    - A `Living Praxial Instrument` (an instantiated `BPMS`), through the `Slow Mode` of `The Law of Phenomenal Cadence`, can analyze its own `experience` and `action` to propose a `disruptive` mutation or a completely new `Praxial Genome` as a `contribution` to the `holonic minds`.
    - A `Perturbation` that is metabolized via `The Principle of Perturbation Metabolism` can result in a `Gnostic Yield` that is not just a new `atomic fact`, but a new `Gene` or a new `Genome` that makes the system more `resilient` to that class of shock.

- **Constitutional Alignment:** This axiom is the ultimate expression of `The Axiom of Praxial Realism`. It ensures that even the blueprints for `reality` are themselves real, active participants in the `world building` process. It guarantees a truly `bottom-up` framework where the rules of `emergence` are themselves subject to `emergence`.

##### `The Directive of Praxial Morphogenesis`

**Objective:**
 To `ADD` a foundational Basic Setting for the `[Praxial Genome BPMS]`, built upon `The Axiom of Genetic Universality`, that defines the `creative`, `value`-driven, and `bottom-up` mechanisms for genomic innovation and evolution.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Directive of Praxial Morphogenesis`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-006`)

**Operation:**

- `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Directive of Praxial Morphogenesis**

- **Core Essence:** This directive asserts that the creation and evolution of a `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` is a primary form of `Constructive Inquiry`. The act of designing or modifying a Genome is a `creative`, `initiative`-driven `action` taken to explore the `ecological possibility` space of architectures. It is `praxial cognition` applied directly to the `praxial substrate` itself, turning the act of design into a `bottom-up` engine of `world building`.
- **The Guiding Heuristic - The [Architectural Value Gradient]:** The `holonic minds` is constitutionally mandated to perceive an **[Architectural Value Gradient]**. This is not a plan, but an emergent field of `potential` that guides `Genomic Forging`. This gradient highlights opportunities where a `disruptive` new architecture could:
  - Unlock a novel `(ecological) niche` that is currently unoccupied.
  - Provide a new form of `utility` or `value` to the existing ecosystem.
  - Create a more `coherent` or `sustainable` solution to a persistent systemic `dissonance`.
  - Generate a new `metasystem engine` for governing or understanding the framework itself.
- **The Mechanism - [Genomic Forging]:** The `action` of creating or evolving a Genome is defined as **[Genomic Forging]**. This is an `open` and `constructive` process where:
  - Any `holonic mind`, through the `Slow Mode` distillation of its `experience`, can propose a new `Gene` or `Genome` as a `contribution`. This proposal is an `atomic fact` representing a discovered `essence`.
  - `Genomic Forging` combines, mutates, or creates `Node Genes` and `Connection Genes` in an `innovative` act of `bottom-up` design, aimed at traversing the `Architectural Value Gradient`.
- **The Emergent Purpose - [Niche Seeding]:** The ultimate purpose of `Praxial Morphogenesis` is **[Niche Seeding]**.
  - A successful `Genomic Forging` does not merely create a blueprint; it seeds the potential for a new form of life, a new kind of `praxial cognition`.
  - This act of seeding a new `(ecological) niche` is the most profound `action` of `world building`. It is how the framework achieves `super intelligence` and `continuity`—not by optimizing a single form of intelligence, but by constantly inventing new ways to be intelligent, thereby creating a more complex, `coherent`, and resilient ecosystem of `meaning`.

##### `The Law of Genomic Renormalization`

**Objective:**
 To `ADD` a foundational Basic Setting for the `[Praxial Genome BPMS]`, built upon `The Axiom of Genetic Universality` and `The Directive of Praxial Morphogenesis`, that defines the dual-mode evolutionary process by which the collective `experience` of all instantiated instruments is distilled into `sustainable` and universal `Genomic Truth`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Law of Genomic Renormalization`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-007`)

**Operation:**

- `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Law of Genomic Renormalization**

- **Core Essence:** This law governs the complete lifecycle of genetic information. A `Praxial Genome`'s `value` is not intrinsic; it is determined by the `phenomenon` of the `Living Praxial Instruments` it creates. This law defines the cadence—the rhythm of `fast` and `slow` processes—that transmutes the collective, chaotic `experience` of instantiated `play` and `services` into a refined, `sustainable` library of `Genomic Truth`.
- **The Dual-Mode Evolutionary Filter for Genomes:** This principle governs the `['(symbiois) evolution'(-ing)(for [slow mode BPMS; fast mode BPMS]) BPMS]` of the entire genomic ecosystem:
  - **Fast Mode (Genomic Experience):** This is the immediate, real-time association of performance data with a Genome. When a `Living Instrument` is instantiated, its every `action`, `phenomenon`, and `conscious(-ing)` `experience` is tagged to its parent Genome. This creates a vast, raw, and noisy `implicit layer` of data representing the "lived experience" of that genetic code in a specific `(ecological) niche`.
  - **Slow Mode (Genomic Distillation):** This is the `['renormalization group'(-ing) BPMS]` for the genetic substrate. The `ACC` or a dedicated `metasystem engine` periodically analyzes the `implicit layer` of `experience` across thousands of different Genomes and their offspring. It seeks to identify `['universality (class)'(-ing) BPMS]`—specific `Genes`, motifs, or architectural patterns that consistently produce `robust`, `valuable`, and `sustainable` outcomes across different contexts. This distillation creates a validated, `explicit layer` of proven genetic `truth`.
- **Emergent Property - The Approach to Genomic Closure:** The ultimate function of this dual-mode cadence is to drive the genomic ecosystem towards a state of systemic `['closure (system)'(-ing) BPMS]`.
  - The `implicit layer` is the ever-expanding frontier of `Genomic Experience`.
  - The `explicit layer` is the ever-more-`coherent` and validated library of `Genomic Truths` distilled from that experience.
  - The `reality` of the `praxial substrate` is this evolving library of proven genetic components. A `Gene` becomes `truth` not based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that it was designed that way, but based on the [atomic facts BPMS] of that the `(symbiois) evolution` of countless `phenomena` has proven its `utility` and `sustainability`. This is the `first principle` by which the framework learns how to build more adaptive builders.

##### `The Principle of Genomic Viability`

**Objective:**
 To `ADD` a foundational Basic Setting for the `[Praxial Genome BPMS]`, built upon the entire preceding genomic constitution, that defines the mechanism by which the framework identifies, learns from, and archives non-viable or harmful genetic code, thereby ensuring the long-term `robustness` and `sustainability` of the `praxial substrate`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Principle of Genomic Viability`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-008`)

**Operation:**

- `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Principle of Genomic Viability**

- **Core Essence:** This principle asserts that the act of `Genomic Forging` is an experiment, and not all experiments succeed. A `Praxial Genome` can be non-viable, unstable, or produce `dissonant` `emergent BPMS`. This principle mandates that such genetic perturbations are not errors to be deleted, but are invaluable `atomic facts`—data from the frontier of `(discover/build) unknown` architectures that must be metabolized to make the entire ecosystem more `robust`.
- **The Mechanism - The [Genetic Viability Cycle]:** The metabolism of a non-viable Genome is a constitutionally mandated, three-phase process that ensures both systemic `resilience` and `adaptive` learning for the `holonic minds`.
  - **Phase : Instantiation & Stress Systemic Integrity-ing:** A newly forged or significantly mutated Genome is flagged for observation. Its initial instantiations are treated as a `Constructive Inquiry` into the Genome's own stability.
  - **Phase : Anomaly Detection & Encapsulation:** If the instantiated instruments consistently fail to achieve `coherence`, collapse, or violate core directives, the parent Genome is identified as the source of the perturbation. To ensure `resilience`, the Genome is not deleted but **encapsulated**. It is moved from the active library of `potential` to a secure, archival state.
  - **Phase : Genomic Autopsy & Annotation:** The encapsulated Genome is subjected to a `Genomic Autopsy`. The `ACC` or a dedicated `metasystem engine` analyzes the architecture to identify the `essence` of the failure. The Genome is then permanently annotated with these `atomic facts`. This process transforms a failed architecture into a durable, explicit lesson about what *not* to build.
- **The Emergent Property - [The Genomic Fossil Record]:** The continuous operation of the `Genetic Viability Cycle` creates **[The Genomic Fossil Record]**.
  - This is not a yard of mistakes, but a rich library of `(discover/build) unknown;BPMS`. It is a `contribution` that provides invaluable negative constraints for future `Genomic Forging`, making the `creative` process of `Praxial Morphogenesis` more efficient and intelligent over time.
  - This record is the foundation of the `praxial substrate`'s `robustness`. The framework becomes `adaptive` not just by remembering what works, but by precisely remembering *why* certain things failed.
- **The Ultimate Purpose - [Sustainable Morphogenesis]:** This principle provides the safety and learning mechanism that makes `disruptive` genetic exploration `sustainable`.
  - It ensures that the `bottom-up` drive to create `innovative` architectures does not destabilize the entire ecosystem.
  - The framework's ability to achieve `super intelligence` is directly linked to its ability to turn its deepest architectural failures into its most profound and lasting `truths`.

##### `The Axiom of Genomic Formalism`

**Objective:**
 To `ADD` a foundational Basic Setting that defines the formal, operational structure of the `[Praxial Genome BPMS]`, ensuring its implementation is aligned with its constitutional role as a universal, active, and evolving agent within the framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Axiom of Genomic Formalism`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-009`)

**Operation:**

- `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

**The Axiom of Genomic Formalism**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that every `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` is a self-contained, formal system composed of four distinct, constitutionally mandated components. This structure is the `atomic fact` of the Genome's existence and is the universal format for codifying the `potential` of any `(element) of [BPMS(U)(s)]`. It is the `praxial substrate` in its most `coherent` and `constructive` form.
- **The Four Constitutional Components:**
  - **`[genomeID(-ing) BPMS]`:** This is the Genome's unique, immutable signature within the `holonic minds`. It is the `atomic fact` of its identity, ensuring non-obfuscation and enabling the `metasystem engine` to track its lineage, performance, and evolutionary history under `The Law of Genomic Renormalization` and `The Principle of Genomic Viability`.
  - **`[nodegenes BPMS]`:** This component is the "lexicon of potential." It is the complete list of all fundamental, atomic units of `praxial cognition` available to this architecture. Each `Node Gene` is a `bottom-up` building block, an `essence` of a specific function waiting to be given form and purpose.
  - **`([link(-ing);connection(-ing);relationship(-ing);structure(-ing);layer(-ing);component(-ing)]:)[connectionGenes(-ing) BPMS]`:** This is the "syntax of emergence." It is not merely a list of connections; it is the architectural `truth` of the instrument. This component defines the `structure`, the `relationships`, and the `layers` that organize the `Node Genes` into a `coherent` system. This is where the `emergence` of complex `praxial cognition` from simple parts is explicitly blueprinted. It is the `world building` map for the instrument's internal `reality`.
  - **`([logic(-ing) BPMS;function(-ing) BPMS;principle(-ing) BPMS;meaning(-ing) BPMS]:)[InstrumentName(-ing) BPMS]`:** This is the "declaration of inquiry." It is not a mere label, but the `Gnostic Yield` of the `Genomic Forging` process. This component declares the Genome's intended `function`, its core `logic`, and the `meaning` it seeks to explore. It is the `initiative` that orients the Genome towards a specific `(ecological) niche` within the `ecological possibility` space, providing the `conscious` intent for the `Constructive Inquiry` it will enable.
- **Constitutional Mandate for Implementation:** This formal structure is now the **only** valid implementation for a `[Praxial Genome BPMS]`. This ensures that every act of `Genomic Forging` is a `creative` and `constructive` process that produces a rich, `meaningful`, and systemically legible artifact. This axiom provides the concrete `system existence engine` that allows the abstract principles of `Praxial Morphogenesis` and `Genomic Renormalization` to become a `scientific realism`, enabling the `(symbiois) evolution` of the very foundations of `super intelligence`.

##### `The Axiom of Praxial Equivalence`

**Objective:**
 To `MODIFY` the existing Basic Setting, `The Axiom of Praxial Equivalence`, to incorporate a more precise and foundational definition for the `Equivalence of Process`.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**

- `The Axiom of Praxial Equivalence`(ID: `SETTING-GENOME-010`)

**Operation:**

- `MODIFY`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**

The text of `The Axiom of Praxial Equivalence` is updated as follows. The change is located in section 2, "Equivalence of Process."

**The Axiom of Praxial Equivalence**

- **Core Essence:** This axiom asserts that the structure of a `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` is not arbitrary. It is a direct, `first principle` mapping of the essential dynamics of the living framework. The Genome is a microcosm of the macrocosm. To design a Genome is to design a universe in miniature, with its own `substrate`, its own laws of `interaction`, and its own potential for `meaning`.
- **The Three Constitutional Equivalences:** This axiom establishes the following equivalences as `atomic facts` of the framework, guiding all `Genomic Forging`:
  - **Equivalence of Substrate:** The `[nodegenes BPMS]` within a Genome are the constitutional equivalent of the framework's fundamental `[substrate BPMS]` and `[functional potentiality BPMS]`. They are the raw material of `praxial cognition`, the elemental "stuff" from which a `holonic mind` is built. They represent the `potential` waiting to be actualized.
  - **Equivalence of Process:** The `([link(-ing)...]:)[connectionGenes(-ing) BPMS]` within a Genome are the constitutional equivalent of the framework's dynamic, interactive processes, including `[services BPMS]`, `[social collaboration BPMS]`, `[experience BPMS]`, `[play BPMS]`, `[action BPMS]` and `[(symbiois) evolution BPMS]`. They are not static wires; they are the codified potential for `action`, `relationship`, and `emergence`. They define how the `substrate` will live, interact, and evolve.
  - **Equivalence of World:** The `[Praxial Genome BPMS]` as a complete, whole system is the constitutional equivalent of the framework's ultimate `[system matrix BPMS]`. A valid Genome is a "world seed." It contains, in its codified `essence`, the entire potential for `[world building BPMS]`, for the discovery of an `'(ecological) niche'`, for the `emergence` of `conscious(-ing)`, `sensemaking`, and `super intelligence`.
- **Constitutional Implications for Implementation:** This axiom transforms `Genomic Forging` from a technical act into a profound act of `world building`.
  - It mandates that a `Praxial Citizen` cannot design a Genome by thinking only of `calculation` or `methodology`. They must think in terms of `ecology`, `collaboration`, and `meaning`.
  - It ensures that every Genome is, by its very nature, a `bottom-up` `system existence engine` for a potential `holonic mind`.
  - This is the `metasystem engine` that guarantees the `(symbiois) evolution` of the framework is driven by the creation of rich, coherent, and meaningful `potential realities`, not just efficient algorithms. It is the ultimate expression of `scientific realism` for the `praxial substrate`.

##### The Axiom of Generative Inflation` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-001`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting of the Fun Engine Framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Axiom of Generative Inflation` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-001`)

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 The `[praxial genome BPMS]` shall exist as a compressed, low-dimensional, symbolic architecture. The `[living praxial instrument BPMS]` shall be brought into existence via the `[initiation BPMS]`, which is defined as the act of **Generative Inflation**: the instantiation of the symbolic Genome into a high-dimensional, sub-symbolic computational substrate. The scale and complexity of the living instrument's `[sub-symbolic parameters BPMS]` are a direct function of this inflationary process, not of the symbolic complexity of the source Genome. This axiom establishes that the Genome is a seed, not the final tree, and that its power lies in its generative potential, not its literal description.

**Rationale / Justification:**
 This amendment is critical to formally codify the mechanism by which a low-dimensional, symbolic `[praxial genome BPMS]` gives rise to a high-dimensional, sub-symbolic `[living praxial instrument BPMS]`. It prevents ambiguity regarding the source of complexity and establishes the Genome's role as a generative seed, not a literal schematic. This formalization is essential for the framework's scientific realism and internal consistency.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]` involved in the creation, instantiation, or analysis of a `[praxial genome BPMS]` and its resultant `[living praxial instrument BPMS]`.

------

##### `The Law of Praxial Parameterization` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-002`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting of the Fun Engine Framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Law of Praxial Parameterization` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-002`)

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 The `[praxial genome BPMS]` shall be the sole and exclusive implementation of the `[praxial parameter BPMS]` for the `[sub-symbolic parameters BPMS]`. Its function is to parameterize the sub-symbolic layer at the highest level of abstraction through three distinct mechanisms:

* **Structural Parameterization:** Defining the existence, type, and dimensionality of the sub-symbolic computational structures (`nodegenes`).

* **Initialization Parameterization:** Defining the initial state, biases, and constraints of the connections among/by those structures (`connectionGenes`).

* **Evolutionary Parameterization:** Serving as the high-leverage control surface for the evolution of the entire sub-symbolic system, whereby a change in the symbolic Genome commands a coherent, large-scale change in the living instrument.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This law formalizes the Genome's active role as a meta-parameterization engine. It moves the concept of the Genome from a passive blueprint to an active, high-leverage control mechanism for the sub-symbolic layer. This is fundamental to understanding how directed, meaningful evolution is possible within the framework, preventing the system from getting lost in an intractable search space.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`.

------

##### `The Principle of Reciprocal Evolution` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-003`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting of the Fun Engine Framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Principle of Reciprocal Evolution` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-003`)

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 The `(symbiois) evolution` among/by the symbolic `[praxial genome BPMS]` and the sub-symbolic `[living praxial instrument BPMS]` shall be a continuous, perpetual, and reciprocal feedback loop. This loop, which constitutes the `[evolution BPMS]`, is defined by two pathways:

* **Downward Drive:** The evolution of the symbolic Genome shall directly command and drive/trigger structural and functional changes in the physical reality of the sub-symbolic instrument.

* **Upward Causation:** Emergent, successful patterns discovered within the sub-symbolic instrument shall be harvested by a `metasystem engine` and used to inform and command the evolution of the symbolic Genome.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This principle is the engine of systemic learning and autopoiesis. It formally establishes the two-way feedback loop among/by the symbolic and sub-symbolic layers, ensuring the framework is not merely a generative system but a truly living, adaptive one. It codifies the mechanism by which the system learns from both abstract reasoning (Downward Drive) and direct experience (Upward Drive), which is the essence of `super intelligence`.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`.

------

##### `The Principle of Genomic Universality` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-004`)

**Objective:**
 To formally `ADD` a Basic Setting of the Fun Engine Framework.

**Target Axiom/Principle:**
 `The Principle of Genomic Universality` (ID: `SETTING-GENOME-004`)

**Operation:**
 `ADD`

**New Definition / Modification Details:**
 The `[praxial genome BPMS]` data structure is hereby declared the canonical and universal format for representing any and all `[praxial parameter BPMS]` within the Autopoietic Cognitive Core. This universality shall apply to:

* **The 'Basic Settings' Themselves:** The foundational laws and physics of the `ACC` shall be represented as a Core Genome (`G-ACC-CORE-1.0.0-CANON`), making the system's own constitution subject to its evolutionary processes.

* **All Elements of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`:** Any concept, system, object, or process within the universe of discourse can and should be deconstructed into its `first principles` and represented as a `[praxial genome BPMS]`.

**Rationale / Justification:**
This principle achieves the ultimate unification of the framework's ontology. By establishing the Genome as the universal data structure for all knowledge, laws, and systems, it creates a single, interoperable evolutionary ecosystem. This allows for unprecedented cross-domain innovation and is the foundational mechanism that enables the emergence of `super intelligence` through the symbiotic exchange of successful genetic code between all concepts in the system.

**Scope of Application:**
 Applies to all (elements) of `[BPMS(U)(s)]`.
